<h3><u>Important notes</u></h3>
<ul class="h3p">
  <li> Complete this project by yourself (i.e., without a partner). You may discuss the assignment with others 
       in the class, but your solution must be entirely your own work.

      and <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/programming-guidelines.shtml">Programming Guidelines</a> before you begin.  
      In particular, note that the write-up is worth a substantial portion of the grade. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Each file you turn in should have your name at the top of the file.</b></li>
  <li>You <strong>must</strong> implement the list and array stacks by hand. You should not use any classes from
      Java libraries (You should not use any import statements, except <tt>java.util.EmptyStackException</tt>).
  </li>
  <li>You must not change the provided <tt>DStack.java</tt> and <tt>GStack.java</tt> files, 
      and your stacks must implement these interfaces as provided to you.

  <li>Any extra credit must be attempted after finishing &amp; turning in all codes for phase B. 
      *DO NOT MIX* your extra credit stuff with your phase B files!
  </li>
  <li>Your code should not contain any compile warnings. In GArrayStack, you will encounter a non-avoidable warning which
      you are allowed to suppress using <tt>@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")</tt> annotation. However, you are NOT allowed to
      suppress any other warnings, you should instead fix your code to remove the warnings.

<!--== Introduction ==========================================================================================-->
<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<p>
  The purpose of this project is to implement a Stack ADT in the two most common ways, an array and a linked list.  
  In phase A, you'll implement stacks for Java <tt>double</tt> numbers. Then in phase B, you'll implement generic stacks 
  and instantiate them with type <tt>Double</tt>.
</p>
<p>
  Your Stack implementations will be used to do sound manipulation, namely reversing a sound clip. This process, 
  called "backmasking," was used by musicians including the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and Ozzy Ozbourne, 
  although it seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years. Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking">here</a> 
  for a history of this (sometimes controversial!) practice. "But wait," you say, "CSE 143 never taught me 
  how to work with music..." Don't worry! All the music-handling parts have been done for you.
</p>




<!--== Assignment ==========================================================================================================-->
<h2 id="Assignment">The Assignment</h2>
<hr>
You'll need these files to start out: <tt><a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/Reverse.java">Reverse.java</a></tt>, 
<tt><a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/DStack.java">DStack.java</a></tt>, <tt><a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/GStack.java">GStack.java</a></tt>
<ul>
  <li>The code provided for you will read in a sound file, but it does so in <tt>.dat</tt> format.  
      You'll use a program called <tt>sox</tt> to convert wav files to <tt>.dat</tt>: You can find information on it 
      <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/sound.html#sox">here</a> and also on how to use it <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/Sox_Usage.txt">here</a><a>.
  </a></li><a>
  </a><li><a>Later, when you are ready to run your program and the <tt>sox</tt> program, you will want these sound files:
      <tt></tt></a><tt><a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/bot.wav">bot.wav</a></tt>, <tt><a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/secret.wav">secret.wav</a></tt>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  You will write a program that reads a sound file in the <tt>.dat</tt> format (explained below), and writes another 
  <tt>.dat</tt> sound file which is the reverse of the first. We provide you with a class <tt>Reverse</tt> whose main
  method reads in a <tt>.dat</tt> sound file, pushes all the sound values on a stack, then pops them all off and writes 
  them into a new <tt>.dat</tt> sound file. We've also provided you interfaces <tt>DStack</tt> (for Phase A) 
  and <tt>GStack</tt> (for Phase B), which define the stacks you will implement. 
  Your first job is to familiarize yourself with these files.
  The music-reversing code will use your stack implementations in only certain ways, <b>for this project, you should 
  test that your stacks are correct in cases other than those used by the <tt>Reverse</tt> program</b>.
</p>




<!--== Phase A ============================================================================================================-->
<h2 id="PhaseA">Phase A Programming</h2>
<hr>
<p>
  For phase A, you need to provide <i>two</i> stack implementations, one using an array and one using a linked list.  
  They should be called <tt>ArrayStack</tt> and <tt>ListStack</tt>, respectively. They should implement the 
  <tt>DStack</tt> interface given to you. Once you provide these implementations, <tt>Reverse</tt> should work and 
  create backwards sound files. It should take no more than a page or two of code to provide the implementations.  
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your array implementation should start with an array of size 10 elements and <i>resize</i> to use an array 
      <i>twice as large</i> whenever the array becomes full, copying over the elements in the smaller array. 
  </li>
  <li>When growing your array, do your copying "by hand" with a loop, do not use Arrays.copyOf or other similar methods. 
      It is good to know that these methods exist, but for now we want to focus on understanding everything that is 
      going on "under the covers" as we talk about efficiency. Using the length property of an array is perfectly fine.
  </li>
  <li>For your linked list implementation, you should implement your own linked list nodes and build a stack out of those, 
      similar to the slides from lecture 1 that do the same thing for a queue. You should *NOT* be using any classes 
      from Java collections. You may include your node class as a separate file (Don't forget to submit this file!)  
      or as a nested/inner class. Either will be fine.
  </li>
  <li>Both <tt>ArrayStack</tt> and <tt>ListStack</tt> should throw an <tt>EmptyStackException</tt> if <tt>pop()</tt> 
      or <tt>peek()</tt> is called when the stack is empty. To use <tt>EmptyStackException</tt>, add the following line to your file:<br>
      <code>import java.util.EmptyStackException;</code>
  </li>    
  <li>Note that your solution to Phase A does not require making changes to <tt>Reverse.java</tt>.</li>
</ul>





<!--== Phase B ============================================================================================================-->
<h2 id="PhaseB">Phase B Programming</h2>
<hr> 
<p>
  For phase B, you need to provide <i>two more</i> stack implementations, these implementing the interface 
  <tt>GStack&lt;T&gt;</tt>.  Create classes called <tt>GArrayStack</tt> and <tt>GListStack</tt> that are just like
  <tt>ArrayStack</tt> and <tt>ListStack</tt> except that they are generic in the type of elements kept in the stack.
  The simplest approach is to <i>copy</i> <tt>ArrayStack</tt> and <tt>ListStack</tt> and then make appropriate
  changes.  Normally such copy-and-paste is poor form, but here the pedagogical purpose is to show you how
  little you need to change to make the code generic — and we want to grade all four stack implementations.
  To use your generic stacks you will need to modify <tt>Reverse.java</tt> by replacing the 3 occurrences of:
</p>
<p><code>System.err.println("no support for generics yet");<br>System.exit(1);</code></p>
<p>
  with appropriate code.  Again, the code you write will be only slightly different from non-generic code 
  that is already there.  Do not make other changes to <tt>Reverse.java</tt>.<br>
  Note: Creating generic arrays can be a bit tricky at first; check out these 
  <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/genericArrays.html">notes</a> (mainly workaround #1) for help.
</p>  


<h3><u>Running Your Program</u></h3>
<p class="h3p">
  The <tt>Reverse</tt> program takes 4 arguments (a.k.a. "command-line arguments"). 
  The first is the word <tt>array</tt> or
  <tt>list</tt>, and specifies which implementation to use.  The second is the word
  <tt>double</tt> or <tt>generic</tt>; the latter is for Phase B.
  The next two are the input and output <tt>.dat</tt> file names (you need to
  include the <tt>.dat</tt> extension). From the command-line, you can run the program
  with something like:
</p>
 <pre>java Reverse list double in.dat out.dat</pre>
<p>
  To run your program in Eclipse, create a "Run Configuration" and under the "Arguments" tab 
  put the arguments (e.g., <tt>list double in.dat out.dat</tt>) in the "Program arguments" box.  
  Here are some more tips about <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/sections/week1/proj1_eclipse.html">using Eclipse with Project 1</a>.
  To run <tt>Reverse</tt>, you will need a <tt>.dat</tt> file, which you can create from a <tt>.wav</tt> file 
  as explained in the <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/sound.html#DigitalSound">Digital Sound</a> section.  
  It may also be useful for you to create some short <tt>.dat</tt> files by hand to confirm that you are getting the right results. 
</p>


<h3><u>Write up (Due with Phase B)</u></h3>
<p class="h3p">
  Submit a <tt>README.pdf</tt> file, answering the questions in this template README file: 
  (<a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/README.docx"><tt>README.docx</tt></a>, <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/README.pdf"><tt>README.pdf</tt></a>)<br>
  Note that the write-up questions can all be turned in for Phase B, but some of them (1-7) refer to work 
  you did in Phase A, so you may wish to start on them early.
</p>




<!--================================================================================================================================-->
<h2 id="AboveAndBeyond">Above and Beyond (Due with Phase B)</h2>
<hr>  
<p>
  The following list of suggestions are meant for you to try only if you finish the requirements early. 
  Please be sure that your stack implementations have been thoroughly tested and you have checked your writeup carefully 
  before attempting any of these (Completed phaseB and turned in all phaseB code). 
  Recall that any extra-credit you complete is noted and kept separate in the gradebook and *may* 
  be used to adjust your grade at the end of the quarter, as detailed in the
  <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/grading-policies.shtml">course grading policy</a>.<br> 
  <i>Note: please turn in all extra credit files separately, as described under 'Turn-in'. DO NOT MIX it with Phase B code!</i><br>
  <i>Note: You need to describe each of your implementations in detail in your write-up to get credit</i>
</p>
  
<ol>
  <li>(least difficult) Modify your array implementations so that when the array is 3/4 empty, the stack resizes to use 
      an array of half the size.
  </li>
  <li>(somewhat more difficult) Implement the Karplus-Strong algorithm (to generate "reverb" sounds). 
      A description of this algorithm is available <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/14sp/projects/project1/karplus_strong.html">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>(most difficult) Assuming that your <tt>.dat</tt> input file contained a single note, try writing a program 
      which will output a single-octave scale beginning at that note. Would the notes of an "evenly spaced" 
      scale grow logarithmically, linearly, polynomially, or according to some other function? For more information about 
      the evenly-spaced scale, refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_scale">this article</a>.
      To earn full credit, you must start from an actual recorded note (not a synthetic one) and generate 
      the single-octave scale.  It's fine if the note durations are decreasing. 
  </li>
</ol>
